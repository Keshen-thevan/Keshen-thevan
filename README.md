I'm Keshen Thevan, a passionate self taught web and blockchain developer. My passion lies in creating amazing interactive applications that anyone can use. I love the design side of creating these applications because it allows me to let my imagination flow. One of the best feelings in the world is getting to see the things I created
from my blood, sweat and tears.

I am super eager to learn more and build even more breathtaking websites.
